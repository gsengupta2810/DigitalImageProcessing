Score Function:- A function that maps raw data to scores 
Loss function :- Quatifies the agreement between predictied scores and ground truth labels.

Linear classifier. In this module we will start out with arguably the simplest possible function, a linear mapping:
	f(xi,W,b)=Wxi+b
	f(xi,W,b)=Wxi+b
In the above equation, we are assuming that the image xixi has all of its pixels flattened out to a single column vector of shape [D x 1]. The matrix W (of size [K x D]), and the vector b (of size [K x 1]) are the parameters of the function. In CIFAR-10, xixi contains all pixels in the i-th image flattened into a single [3072 x 1] column, W is [10 x 3072] and b is [10x 1], so 3072 numbers come into the function (the raw pixel values) and 10 numbers come out (the class scores).
